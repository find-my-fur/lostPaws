      A group of passionate developers set out to create an app that helps shelter 
      animals find loving homes! 
       We started by researching the challenges faced by 
      shelters and adopters, realizing there was a real need for a user-friendly platform 
      to connect them. Collaborating closely with shelters, we gathered data on available pets
       and designed features that let users filter by breed, size, and age. Our goal is to make 
        the adoption process easier and more enjoyable, with your help we can achieve this! <br></br>
